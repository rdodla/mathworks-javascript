# Lab 01

A series of labs covering data and the Document Object Model.

## Lab 01-1

Uncomment the import statement which defines users  
Using `users`, create an array `names` which contains the full name of each user as a string.   
For example: `['John Paxton', 'Dann Russo']`.  
Print the `names` array to the console.

## Lab 01-2

Render the list of names as an unordered list, with each list item a full name.

## Lab 01-3

Add a div with a label, text field, and button.
When the button is clicked on
* Add the content in the text field to the list of names
* Add the new name to the unordered list in HTML
* Blank out the content in the text field

## Lab 01-4
Add a div with a label and text field.
Content in the text field filters the list of names. If you enter 'Smi' in the text field, 'John Smith' should match but 'Sam Jones' should not.   
Filter as the user types. No button to click on here.  
What happens when the user deletes content from the text field?
